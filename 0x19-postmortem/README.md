Timeline

10:00 AM PST: The issue was first detected by our monitoring system.
10:05 AM PST: An engineer investigated the issue and determined that the Nginx server had crashed.
10:10 AM PST: The engineer restarted the Nginx server, but it crashed again.

Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a configuration error in the Nginx server. The configuration file for the Nginx server was missing a line that specified the amount of memory that the server could use. This caused the server to crash when it exceeded the amount of memory that it was allowed to use.

The issue was resolved by correcting the configuration file for the Nginx server. The line that was missing was added to the file, and the server was restarted. The website was restored to service after the server was restarted.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent this issue from happening again, we will:

Add more monitoring to the Nginx server so that we can detect configuration errors more quickly.
Create a process for reviewing and approving Nginx configuration changes before they are implemented.
Educate our engineers about the importance of correct Nginx configuration.
Conclusion

This incident was a learning experience for us. We have taken steps to prevent this issue from happening again, and we are confident that our website will be more resilient in the future.
